go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/
click to download the windows installer msi file
open the file to start the installer
I used all the defaults and checked the box to include extra things like Chocolatey
once the node installation finished it popped up a cmd line windows to install all the extras. 
possibly this is not necessary. if someone tries without please update this Readme
